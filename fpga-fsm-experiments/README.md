# FSM Experiments on FPGA

## Overview
This project contains a set of practical experiments focused on finite state machine (FSM)
design and behavior on FPGA platforms.

## Key Features
- Multiple FSM implementations
- State transition and output behavior analysis
- Practical FSM experimentation
- FPGA-based control logic design

## Design Approach
Different FSM structures are implemented to observe state behavior, transition conditions,
and output responses. The experiments emphasize synchronous design principles and
clear state definition.

## Tools & Technologies
- FPGA-based digital design
- Verilog / VHDL
- Xilinx FPGA development tools

## Results
- Correct and stable FSM operation
- Clear observation of state transitions
- Improved understanding of FSM behavior in real hardware environments

## Notes
These experiments focus on reinforcing FSM design concepts through hands-on FPGA implementations.
