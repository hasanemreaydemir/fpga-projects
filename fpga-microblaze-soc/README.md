# MicroBlaze System-on-Chip (SoC) Design on FPGA

## Overview
This project implements a System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture on FPGA using the MicroBlaze soft-core processor.
The design integrates processor, memory, and peripherals into a complete embedded system.

## Key Features
- MicroBlaze soft-core processor
- Memory-mapped peripheral integration
- Embedded software and hardware interaction
- FPGA-based SoC architecture

## Design Approach
The system is designed using a modular SoC approach where the MicroBlaze processor communicates
with on-chip memory and peripherals through a standardized bus interface.
The focus is on hardware–software integration rather than standalone logic design.

## Tools & Technologies
- MicroBlaze soft-core processor
- Xilinx FPGA development tools
- Embedded C programming
- Hardware–software co-design

## Results
- Functional MicroBlaze-based SoC
- Successful communication between processor and peripherals
- Stable embedded system operation on FPGA

## Notes
This project emphasizes system-level FPGA design and embedded software integration using a soft-core processor.
