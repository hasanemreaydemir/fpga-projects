# FPGA Projects

This repository contains a collection of FPGA-based digital design projects focusing on
hardware-oriented system design and implementation.

## Overview
The projects in this repository cover a range of FPGA design topics including arithmetic circuits,
finite state machines (FSMs), image processing systems, and embedded processor-based designs using MicroBlaze.
The main focus is on understanding digital design concepts at the system level rather than isolated HDL coding.

## Included Projects
- **Carry Select Adder (32-bit)**  
  High-speed arithmetic circuit design and analysis.
- **Finite State Machines (FSM)**  
  FSM-based digital system design and implementation.
- **FSM Experiments**  
  Practical FSM implementations and behavioral analysis.
- **Image Processing System**  
  FPGA-based image processing pipeline design.
- **MicroBlaze System-on-Chip (SoC)**  
  Embedded processor-based system design on FPGA.

## Tools & Technologies
- FPGA-based digital design
- Verilog / VHDL
- Xilinx FPGA development tools
- MicroBlaze soft-core processor
- Hardware-oriented system design

## Notes
These projects emphasize structured digital design, modularity, and system-level thinking rather than
tool-specific or purely academic implementations.
