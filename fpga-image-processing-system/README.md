# FPGA-Based Image Processing System

## Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of an image processing system on FPGA.
The system focuses on handling image data using hardware-oriented processing techniques.

## Key Features
- FPGA-based image processing architecture
- Pixel-level data manipulation
- Modular and pipeline-oriented system design
- Hardware-efficient processing approach

## Design Approach
The image processing system is designed using a modular architecture where image data is
processed sequentially through defined processing stages. The design emphasizes
throughput, timing correctness, and hardware efficiency.

## Tools & Technologies
- FPGA-based digital design
- Verilog / VHDL
- Xilinx FPGA development tools

## Results
- Correct image data processing
- Stable and reliable system behavior
- Demonstration of hardware-based image processing concepts

## Notes
This project focuses on understanding image data flow and processing on FPGA rather than
software-based image processing techniques.
