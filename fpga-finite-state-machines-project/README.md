# Finite State Machine (FSM) Design on FPGA

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of finite state machines (FSMs) on FPGA.
The goal is to model control-oriented digital systems using structured state-based logic.

## Key Features
- Finite state machine design
- State transition logic implementation
- Synchronous digital control system
- FPGA-oriented FSM modeling

## Design Approach
The FSM is designed using a clear separation of state registers, next-state logic, and output logic.
State transitions are triggered synchronously based on input conditions and clock signals.

## Tools & Technologies
- FPGA-based digital design
- Verilog / VHDL
- Xilinx FPGA development tools

## Results
- Correct state transitions and outputs
- Stable and predictable control behavior
- Clear and maintainable FSM architecture

## Notes
This project emphasizes control logic design and structured FSM implementation for FPGA-based systems.
